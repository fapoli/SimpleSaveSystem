# Simple Save System

A simple savegame system that can be used in Unity. It provides some useful serializable classes that are transformed from the non-serializable Unity clases, like for example Vector2, Vector3, Quaternion... It also provides a SaveManager class that saves encrypted save files into your game's data folder.
